note:
From the GDS Service Manual [Using progressive enhancement](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement#dont-assume-users-turn-off-javascript)

You shouldn’t assume the reason for designing a site that works without CSS or JavaScript (or anything else) is because a user chooses to switch these off.

There are many situations when extra layers can fail to load or are filtered. This can happen due to:

 - Temporary network errors
 - DNS lookup failures
 - overload or downtime affecting the server where the resource is found, meaning it fails to respond in time or at all
 - corporate firewalls blocking, removing or altering content (large institutions like banks or government departments may use these)
 - mobile network providers resampling images and altering content to speed up load times and reduce bandwidth usage
 - personal firewalls or antivirus software altering or blocking content
 - internet providers inserting their own code into the page that accidentally conflicts with your own
 Of course, some users turn off features in their browsers deliberately - you should respect their decision and make sure they can still use your service.
