## Protective Markings
 - Official
 - ~~Official Sensitive~~
 - Secret
 - Top Secret

### Handling
- Separate by marking
- Official Sensitive isn't a thing

note:
 - It's important to separate documents/code of differing protective markings as rather than elevating to the highest common dominator.
 - Official sensitive isn't a real thing, it's Official with a handling caveat, it is for use with a **limited** subset of OFFICIAL that if it were lost, stolen or published in the media could have more damaging consequences for individuals, organisation or government.
 - Your code with **very rare** exceptions is Official.
 - It's important to challenge and understand explicity what and why something is beyond Official.
